Hello and welcome to my blog.

I'm Miklos and I'm a developer working out of Copenhagen.

My main interest is functional programming and data processing systems such as Apache Spark and Kafka.
I don't pick sites in the FP and streaming war as I prefer to know more than one tool and choose the best for the particular scenario.

In this blog I will write about these technologies, sometimes compare several approaches and sometimes just dig deep into the inner workings.
